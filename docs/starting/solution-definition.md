# Solution definition

Solution definition for OpenEuropa components is defined by OpenEuropa Solution design team.
Major changes or introductions of new components respect a defined workflow.

For work in new components, the following needs to happen:
- Technical proposal by development team and validated by the Solutions Design Team.
- Code repository correctly created and handed over to dev team.
- Future maintainership of the component is clear and assigned before the work is started.

For small changes in existing components:
- Discuss with OpenEuropa team by opening an issue on Github or ping on #openeuropa slack chat
- Create a PR on the component
- Component maintainers will review and approve

# Repository scaffolding

Repositories follow a certain structure that allows for a fast and easy development setup.

Creating new Drupal module repositories can be done by using the [OpenEuropa module template](https://github.com/openeuropa/drupal-module-template).

In addition, the OpenEuropa project also provides a [site template](https://github.com/openeuropa/drupal-site-template) that can be used to quickly set up a site using a lightweight profile and the more common components already included.

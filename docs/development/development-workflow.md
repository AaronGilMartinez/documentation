# Development workflow

OpenEuropa component development starts from business requirements provided by the European Commission to support various corporate solutions.

The DIGIT core team responsible for the OpenEuropa project analyses these requirements and turns them into generic technical solutions that could support these business goals as well as others.

After the completion of a given requirement in the component, if the latter is used in any European Commission distribution, it is updated and configured to meet the original business requirement.

# CI Deployment Workflow

OpenEuropa is using [Drone](https://drone.fpfis.eu) for continuous integration and continuous delivery of its components. It is integrated with the Github repositories in order to trigger automatically build pipelines for commits and pull requests.

You can see a default Drone pipeline configuration in the [Drupal module template repository](https://github.com/openeuropa/drupal-module-template/blob/master/.drone.yml).

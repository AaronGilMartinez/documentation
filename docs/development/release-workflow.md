# Release workflow

OpenEuropa components follow a semantic version release cycle. For more information about this, go [here](../initiative/release-cycle.md).

They are released every time the maintainers decide enough functionality has been included to create a new minor version or when the new functionality is needed by an existing European Commission distribution.

Patch (or security) updates can be done more often and as needed.

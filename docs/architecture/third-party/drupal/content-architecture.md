# Content architecture

The OpenEuropa project does not enforce a strict content architecture but provides corporate solutions used by the European Commission.

## Content types

The [OpenEuropa Content](https://github.com/openeuropa/oe_content) component provides a growing number of corporate content types intended to harmonize the content architecture across the sites of the European Commission.

Moreover, it provides RDF-based support for the corporate vocabularies published by the European Publication Office (OP).

## Page building

To support the building of pages with a variety of page-level elements, the [OpenEuropa Paragraphs](https://github.com/openeuropa/oe_paragraphs) component provides a number of Drupal paragraph types that can be used
on any content type. Combined with the [OpenEuropa Theme](https://github.com/openeuropa/oe_theme), these are displayed using the [Europa Component Library (ECL)](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library) style guide.

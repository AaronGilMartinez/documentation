# Layout architecture

The OpenEuropa project strictly follows the guidelines put forward by the [Europa Component Library (ECL)](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library).

The implementation of this style guide can be found in the [OpenEuropa Theme](https://github.com/openeuropa/oe_theme) component which is responsible for ensuring that all other OpenEuropa components
are styled and displayed according to the ECL style guide.

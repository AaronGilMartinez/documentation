# Selecting contributed modules

OpenEuropa maintainers work closely with the Drupal community and are responsible for choosing any contributed modules that are needed for their components. The modules are carefully selected based on various criteria such as
usage, development activity, code quality, etc.

Both maintainers of and contributors to OpenEuropa components are encouraged to contribute back to the Drupal community by improving the modules they need and even take maintainership where needed.

# OpenEuropa components

Below the list of loosely coupled, reusable PHP projects provided by the OpenEuropa Initiative.
Each project complies with [PHP-FIG][1] standards and adhere to the best-practices put forward by [PHP The "Right" Way][2].

All code is distributed on [Packagist][3] and released under the [EUPL-1.2 license][4].

All projects use Semantic Versioning. Attention is drawn to [item 4 of the Semantic Versioni specification](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)
'Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.'

In order to achieve such a goal the OpenEuropa Initiative will focus on the following activities:

- Build, maintain and release loosely-coupled, reusable software components, licensed under [EUPL-1.1][3].
- Build, maintain and release fully-fledged solutions for the European Institutions.
- Provide a high-level architecture overview of web-related information systems.
- Establish reusable technical governance guidelines.
- Contribute back to upstream open source projects.
